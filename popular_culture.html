                <p>While cartoons sometimes show penguins flying, real penguins can't fly in the air. However, they are excellent swimmers and can "fly" through the water at speeds up to 15 miles per hour using their flippers!</p>

                <h3>Penguins Don't Live in Igloos</h3>
                <p>Some stories depict penguins living in igloos, but in reality, penguins build nests out of rocks, pebbles, or burrows in the ground. Igloos are shelters built by humans, traditionally used by the Inuit people in the Arctic.</p>
